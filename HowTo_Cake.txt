Cake is an automation tool allowing us to deploy, publish, clean or build our application automatically.

It's called via the build.ps1 powershell script, with a list of argument to pass :

.\build.ps1 -Script build_IdentityServer.cake -target Clean

.\build.ps1 -Script build_IdentityServer.cake -target Deploy -configuration development

etc

The arguments are the usual argument required to deploy an application : 

-configuration (dev, release, test, ...) DEFAULTS TO Release
-framework (you should not need this argument actually) DEFAULTS TO netcoreapp2.0
-runtime (the target runtime) DEFAULTS TO win10-argument
-destinationIp (the Ip of the server) DEFAULTS TO 
-destinationDirectory (where you expect your app to be deployed on the server ) DEFAULTS TO c$\ConsoleApps\Test 
-username (Required if you deploy on ubuntu/linux) DEFAULTS TO ubuntu
-executableName (Required if you deploy on ubuntu/linux, name of the app) DEFAULTS TO Klanik_Internal/IdentityServer respectively


So in order to publish the solution :

.\build.ps1 -Script build_IdentityServer.cake -target Publish
.\build.ps1 -Script build_KlanikInternal.cake -target Publish

These command will clean, restore, build then publish their respective target applications to their publish folder.

To deploy, simply replace "publish" by "Deploy".

Enjoy your cake.
